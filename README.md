# PyCricket

## About
A Python implementation of the classic cricket hand game.

## Getting Started
Simply clone the repository and run `python game.py -h` to see the possible commands.

## Rules
The game has 2 players, a batter and a bowler. The first batter's goal is to set a high score. Once the first batter 
loses all their wickets, the innings will switch and the second player will now bat. The second players goal is to 
beat the first players score before their wickets run out. 

### Scoring
Each player can throw a number from 0 to 6. 
* If the batter and the bowler throw the same score, the batter loses a wicket.
* If the batter hits a number from 1 to 6, then their score will increase by the number.
* If the batter hits a 0, their score will increase by the amount the bowler threw
